# WeatherApp
A Django-based web application designed to fetch, store, and manage historical weather data. This backend provides a REST API to retrieve weather records based on regions, parameters, and years. The application supports automatic daily data fetching, backfilling missing historical data, and robust error logging for failed data fetches.
